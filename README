ScalaSWT is an open source library for the implementation of SWT/JFace applications. It makes possible to write GUI code in a Scala DSL which try to be more readable and concise than in plain Java.

This library is currently only my personal effort and it is a very first version with an experimental character.

You are free to use it or change it but it is on your own responsibility. I don't grant any guaranties for this software.

Enjoy it,
Antonio R. Rodriguez Santiesteban.
